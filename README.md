# My config files

## Setup Vim

Make sure you have `git` installed, vim plugins use it:
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

If you have no idea what is `vim` or never installed anything or configured anything for it, you can install all my configs and plugins by copying all the files:
```bash
cp -r vim/.vim vim/.vimrc ~/
```
Otherwise just take a look at `vim/.vimrc` and read the start of the `vim/vim-shortcuts` file, they have what you need to know.
